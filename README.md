## 🏆 Notable Projects

### Statistics ***[View Project](https://github.com/f-debrandois/Occitanie-Air-Quality-Analysis)***
- This project focuses on analyzing air pollution data from the Occitanie region, exploring various statistical modeling and data visualization techniques to understand emission patterns and their impacts.

### Big Data ***[View Project](S8/BigData%20-%20Virtualisation/Projet)***
- **Project for the Course: Infrastructures for Cloud and Big Data**
  - This project involved implementing a Big Data As-A-Service (BaDaaS) platform. It included setting up a virtual machine cluster, deploying Spark with HDFS, and developing an interface for data upload, program execution, and result retrieval.

### Machine Learning ***[View Project](https://github.com/f-debrandois/ImageNet-CNN-Bias-Analysis)***
- This project explored training state-of-the-art CNN models like LeNet and ResNet on ImageNet data and analyzing the impact of dataset bias on model predictions.

### Wavelets ***[View Project](S8/Ondelettes/Projet)***
- **Poisson Image Editing**
  - The goal of this assignment was to apply the Poisson editing algorithm for image blending. It involved copying spatial gradients from a source image into a target image to achieve more realistic blending effects.
